            main convergency criterion. Iterations stop when the
            largest harmonic amplitude becomes smaller (in absolute
            value) than 'conver' times the harmonic fit rms.
        :param minit: int, default = 10
            minimum number of iterations to perform. A minimum of 10
            iterations guarantees that, on average, 2 iterations will
            be available for fitting each independent parameter (the
            four harmonic amplitudes and the intensity level). In the
            first isophote, the minimum number of iterations is 2 * 'minit',
            to ensure that, even departing from not-so-good initial values,
            the algorithm has a better chance to converge to a sensible
            solution.
        :param maxit: int, default = 50
            maximum number of iterations to perform
        :param fflag: float, default = 0.7
            acceptable fraction of flagged data points in sample.
            If the actual number of valid data points is smaller
            than this, stop iterating and return current Isophote.
            Flagged data points are points that either lie outside
            the image frame, or where rejected by sigma-clipping.
        :param maxgerr: float, default = 0.5
            maximum acceptable relative error in the local radial
            intensity gradient. This is the main control for preventing
            ellipses to grow to regions of too low signal-to-noise ratio.
            It specifies the maximum acceptable relative error in the
            local radial intensity gradient. Experiments (see paper
            quoted in the 'ellipse' help page) showed that the fitting
            precision relates to that relative error. The usual behavior
            of the gradient relative error is to increase with semi-major
            axis, being larger in outer, fainter regions of a galaxy
            image. In the current implementation, the 'maxgerr' criterion
            is triggered only when two consecutive isophotes exceed the
            value specified in the parameter. This prevents premature
            stopping caused by contamination such as stars and HII
            regions.
            A number of actions may happen when the current gradient
            error exceeds 'maxgerr' (or becomes non-significant and is
            set to None) in the process of increasing semi-major axis
            length. If the maximum semi-major axis specified by parameter
            'maxsma' is set to None, semi-major axis grow is stopped and
            the algorithm proceeds inwards to the galaxy image center. If
            'maxsma' is set to some finite value, and this value is larger
            than the current semi-major axis length, the algorithm enters
            non-iterative mode and proceeds outwards until reaching '.maxsma'.
        :param going_inwards: boolean, default = False
            defines the sense of SMA growth. This is used by the Ellipse
            class for defining stopping criteria that depend on the gradient
            relative error. When fitting just one isophote, this parameter
            is used only by the code that defines the details of how
            elliptical arc segments ("sectors") are extracted from the image,
            when using area extraction modes (see parameter 'integrmode' in
            the Sample class).
