class TestRegression(unittest.TestCase):
    '''
    Despite being cast as a unit test, this code implements in fact
    regression testing of the Ellipse algorithm, against results obtained by
    the stsdas$analysis/isophote task 'ellipse'.

    The stsdas task was run on test images and results were stored in tables.
    The code in here runs the Ellipse algorithm on the same images, producing
    a list of Isophote instances. The contents of this list then get compared
    with the contents of the corresponding table.

    Some quantities are compared in assert statements. These were designed to be
    executed only when the synth_highsnr.fits image is used as input. That way,
    we are mainly checking numerical differences that originate in the algorithms
    themselves, and not caused by noise. The quantities compared this way are:

      - mean intensity: less than 1% diff. for sma > 3 pixels, 5% otherwise
      - ellipticity: less than 1% diff. for sma > 3 pixels, 20% otherwise
      - position angle: less than 1 deg. diff. for sma > 3 pixels, 20 deg. otherwise
      - X and Y position: less than 0.2 pixel diff.

    For the M51 image we have mostly good agreement with the spp code in most
    of the parameters (mean isophotal intensity agrees within a fraction of 1%
    mostly), but every now and then the ellipticity and position angle of the
    semi-major axis may differ by a large amount from what the spp code measures.
    The code also stops prematurely wrt the larger sma values measured by the spp
    code. This is caused by a difference in the way the gradient relative error is
    measured in each case, and suggests that the spp code may have a bug.

    The not-so-good behavior observed in the case of the M51 image is to be expected
    though. This image is exactly the type of galaxy image for which the algorithm
    *wasn't* designed for. It has an almost negligible smooth ellipsoidal component,
    and a lot of lumpy spiral structure that causes the radial gradient computation
    to go berserk. On top of that, the ellipticity is small (roundish isophotes)
    throughout the image, causing large relative errors and instability in the fitting
    algorithm.

    For now, we can only check the bi-linear integration mode. The mean and median
    modes cannot be checked since the original 'ellipse' task has a bug that causes
    the creation of erroneous output tables. A partial comparison could be made if we
    write new code that reads the standard output of 'ellipse' instead, captured from
    screen, and use it as reference for the regression.
